# Cache-Lab
An exercise in recreating a cache and simulating its behavior.

csim.c and trans.c are the focus of this project.

csim.c sets up and runs the cache simulation assuming we replace lines that are the least recently used.

trans.c transposes matrices within the cache in a way that minimizes misses.

driver.py was given to me for the assignment to test the two programs and show their accuracy.
